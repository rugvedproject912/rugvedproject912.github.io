<!-- <p class="posttitle"> My day at college today: Thursday 5th June 2025 </p>
<p> Today, I had been working a bit related on my Unit 11 Assignment which is about Digital Graphics and Animation. <br> However, I had been making changes to my main file of that assignment, where I had been attaching my mood board, static logo, dynamic logo and animation to the file and <br> most importantly making it accessible. 
This assignment was, however, extremely challenging <br> and an assignment with lots of various tasks, in which many of them were very unfamiliar to me. Also, I felt that this assignment was not aligned with my interests in this course, because I felt that this assignment was an assignment which to me, seemed like digital artistic designing tasks, rather than computing related tasks. 
But, there were positives from this task, such as learning to use Canva elaboratively, which has contributing to my avidness of this software, due to its vast variety of features and design options, which makes this software very inclusive and user-friendly. </p>
